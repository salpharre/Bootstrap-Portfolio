### Overview

Project webpage is a personal portfolio to showcase past, current and future projects. It is composed of four html files: the home page (index), portfolio page (porfolio), about me page (about), and contact page (contact). Each page can easily be traveled to via the navbar in the header, where my name and a personally made logo graces it.
