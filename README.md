### Overview

Project webpage is a [personal portfolio](https://salpharre.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/) to showcase past, current and future projects. It is composed of four html files: the home page (index), portfolio page (porfolio), about me page (about), and contact page (contact). Each page can easily be traveled to via the navbar in the header, where my name and a personally made logo graces it.

### Usage

At any time you may navigate back to the home page by clicking on the logo or my name in the heading.

##### Home page (index.html) 
There are two ways to navigate:
1. A carousel will showcase a few of the more exemplary projects, clicking on any of the pictures will send you directly to that project in the portfolio page.
2. The navigation bar at the top

##### Portfolio page (portfolio.html)
Showcases a number of different projects, in each section:
1. An image of the project
2. A small description
3. Two buttons, one to the repository, the second to the finished product (or demo for CLI projects)
